;;; Function STATIC evaluates a position from the point of view of a particular player.  It returns a number -- the higher the number, the more desirable the position. If the state is a win we give it a high number (10000) and a loss gets a low number (-10000). The terminal state has utility 0.
;;; The heuristic for non terminal state follows: Eval = (8X_3 + 2X_2 + X_1) - (8O_3 + 2O_2 + O_1).

;;; Function LINE-SCORE accepts a board, player and line and returns the score of that line. If the line contains the opposite player, the score is 0. Only one player gives score 1, two players gives 4 and the rest (3 players) gets a score of 24.

;;; Function GET-POS accepts a board and a list ij and returns the player in position (i,j), or nil if there is no player in that posiion.
