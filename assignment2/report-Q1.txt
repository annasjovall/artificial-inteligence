			FINDINGS FROM CONNECT 4 HEURISTIC


I found an online AI that you can play connect-4 against (connect4.gamesolver.org). Using this I could play optimally against my AI to make sure I could evaluate the different depths in a similar way. As I can start I will always be able to win (proven in 1988 source: Victor Allis "A Knowledge-based Approach of Connect-Four"). Therefore none of the values for *max-depth* will result in a draw or loss. I am thus comparing how long until the AI's lost for each depth, that is how many turns I get before I win.

*max-depth*	turns
    2	 	  6
    3             16
    4		  18

The difference between depth 3 and 4 is not that great. Thus, when playing without the AI depth 3 and 4 are percived to be of the same difficulty, which for me was hard enough. I would therefore say that a depth of 3 is sufficent.
